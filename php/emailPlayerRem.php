 * emailPlayerRem.php is the server side code for the

 * It creates a text email to notify a player
 * that has been removed from a game. If the email
 * creation is successful it then calls sendEmail.php
 * and exits. This leaves it to sendEmail to return the
 * final 'success" status. 
 * 
 * Input consists the following parameters:
 *   login
 *   game
 * 
 * Output, if any, is the echo return status "fail".
